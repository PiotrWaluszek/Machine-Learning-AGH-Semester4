# Machine Learning Course - AGH University of Science and Technology

This repository contains lab tasks and materials for the Machine Learning course at the AGH University of Science and Technology. Each lab folder includes a PDF with tasks, solution files in Jupyter Notebook and Python script formats, and generated output such as images or data files.

## Repository Structure

- `lab01`, `lab02`, ..., `lab14`: Directories containing lab tasks and solutions.
- `data`: Directory containing datasets and additional materials used in labs.
- `.DS_Store`: System file created by macOS, can be ignored.

## How to Use This Repository

To use the materials in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
`git clone https://github.com/PiotrWaluszek/Machine-Learning-AGH-Semester4.git`


2. **Navigate to a lab directory:**
`cd Machine-Learning-AGH-Semester4/lab01`

3. **Install dependencies:** Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages.

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
`jupyter notebook lab01.ipynb`


5. **Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to complete the tasks.**

## Working with Python Scripts

- To run a Python script, use:
`python lab01.py`


On a MacBook, or if you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your system, you might need to use `python3`:
`python3 lab01.py`


Replace `lab01_name.py` with the specific name of the lab you want to run.
